## Charles Olson, Instructor from 1948-1956

Archival materials from the late 1940s through the mid-1950s show that Charles Olson's creative writing pedagogy offered a reinvented vision of the arts curriculum at Black Mountain College. He also did much to fulfill the arts curriculum's most unifying purpose, which was to teach students to draw from their experiences in order to better understand themselves and their communities and how to use that knowledge to make more informed decisions, having developed more holistic understanding of themselves and the world around them. He was consistent in his goal of bringing out the individual voice and style of his students. The goal was that his studentsâ€™ writing would be informed solely by their unique perceptions and experiences and so prompt new cultural formation and expression via the personal and experiential discovery and creation of form.
