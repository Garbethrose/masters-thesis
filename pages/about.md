## About this project. 

This digital thesis is designed to provide archival documents that show a new side to creative writing and its development at Black Mountain college. Centering on three creative writing teachers and their dynamic roles in the BMC community, this digital thesis aims to provide documentation and new information that accompanies my written thesis.

This project marks the beginning of an endeavor to piece together the philosophies that went into the development of creative writing at Black Mountain College and the individuals who fostered the poetic character many associate with the College. Black Mountain College was as much an exchange of ideas as it was a physical space, and many of the practices and ideas that are most famously associated with the college and attributed to a handful of individuals more likely developed through the everyday conversations and inspirations of each member of the community. To gain a better understanding of the motivations, inspirations, and conversations that brought about the ethos of creative writing at BMC, it is necessary to delve beyond what we think we know about the College and get down to the smallest details contained in the Black Mountain College Archives. This website is just one step towards uncovering those stories. While I offer an individual artifact on each pedagogue's page with suggestions as to how to read the archival objects I have hosted on this website, my primary aim is to make less-known BMC archival artifacts more widely available to anyone else who seeks to learn more about the communal history of creative writing at Black Mountain College. All of the photos and Newsletters provided on this website are also available via [Digital NC](https://digital.ncdcr.gov/collections/black-mountain-college), every other artifact has been scanned on-site at the North Carolina Western Regional Archives in Asheville, North Carolins. 

All archival artifacts have been tagged with the following labels:
