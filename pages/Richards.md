## Mary Caroline Richards, Instructor from 1946-1951
Archival materials from the mid-1940s through the early 1950s provide insight into the background work that Richards undertook to make the arts curriculum at Black Mountain College more open and accessible to its students. One of the most transformative experiences that Richards offered the College and its students was the freedom she encouraged in student writing. She celebrated the individuality of each of her students, promoted individual imagination and experience, and defended the individual freedom to choose the form of writing with which to share those experiences. Through her openness to the interests and perspectives of her students, Richards encouraged a communal attitude of autonomy, imagination, and collaboration, which laid the foundation for the culture of creative writing we most often associate with Black Mountain College.
