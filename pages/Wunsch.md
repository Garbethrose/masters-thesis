## William Robert Wunsch -- Instructor from 1933-1945

Currently, the Black Mountain College archives are one of the few places where it is possible to learn about the many ways in which Wunsch's work shaped and sustained the College and its community. After anti-gay police operations resulted in Wunsch's arrest in 1945, the faculty of Black Mountain College opted to veil his departure in secrecy as much as possible. They did not allow any faculty to assist his move-out, and he was largely never spoken of again within the community he had helped build [^1]: Martin Duberman, _Black Mountain: An Exploration in Community_, 230-232 (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1972).  In BMC histories such as _Sprouted Seeds: An Anthology of Personal Accounts_ [^2]: Mervin, Lane, ed., Black Mountain College: Sprouted Seeds: An Anthology of Personal Accounts (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1990). or the Black Mountain College Museum website, one will find very little said about Bob Wunsch and his theater program, creative writing seminars, or his efforts towards racial integration withing the College community. In many ways, this project is geared towards recovering the foundations of learning and community that Bob Wunsch laid down at the College. Any understanding of the College would be incomplete without acknowledging Wunsch and his devotion to his students and community. [^3]Hello 

The archival materials on this website are geared towards Wunschâ€™s pedagogy in his drama and writins courses. Many of these documents exhibit his belief in the therapeutic and instructional effects of theater and literary reading combine the ideas of the effect of group influence, the importance of perception and self-knowledge, and the predicament of the
individualistic student.
